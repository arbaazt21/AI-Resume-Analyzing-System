## ü§ñ **AI Model Used**

The core of this application is powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**, a generative AI model developed by Google. Gemini 1.5 Flash is specifically designed for advanced natural language processing tasks, enabling the application to provide detailed and actionable feedback on resume-job description alignment. The model utilizes semantic analysis to identify key terms, skills, and formatting issues within both the resume and the job description, offering optimization recommendations. Here's how the model is integrated:

```python
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")
```

This model excels in understanding the nuances of job descriptions and resumes, ensuring that the feedback provided is not only accurate but also tailored to the specific needs of job seekers.
